## Python3 Code snippets

Code comments are written after the hash (#) symbol... 

>> (#) This is an example Python3 code comment;  
>> (#) code that is written after the # symbol will NOT be executed;  
>> (#) but, instead, is written using just merely plain English language text...;  
>> (#) so, that even *non-programmer* people will be able to understand how the program works.  

### Example code: Text

>> print("Hello, world!") # output: Hello, world!

### Example code: Numbers

>> print(1+1) # output: 2
